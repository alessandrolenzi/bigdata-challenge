\begin{abstract}
The aim of the project is to analyze and then visualize telecommunication data
in order to discover real-world communities basing on the number of mobile telecommunications (calls and text messages) 
between different geographical areas. We design and implemented 
a parallel computation as a pipeline of
map reduce jobs onto the Hadoop distributed computation
framewor and environment\footnote{http://hadoop.apache.org/}.
In sections \ref{thedataset} and \ref{ds_analysis} of this report, we describe the original dataset
and analyze its properties. Then in section \ref{aggregation}
we explain how we rearranged the data in
order to reduce the noise and improve the tractability and robustness of the
community discovery phase. Sections \ref{approaches} and \ref{mcl} will then
briefly describe two different approaches for community discovery
(finding strongly connected components and markovian clustering)
and in detail describe strategy and implementation of the latter which has
proved to give more significant results.
Finally section \ref{results} will collect results and conclusion of the developed project.
All the implementation code for the project can be found in this
\href{''https://github.com/michele-carignani/hadoop-markov-clustering/''}{online repository}.

\section{Communities discovery approaches}
\label{approaches}

Once the aggregated graph is produced (as list of weighted edges) is time to compute
the communities (i.e. the clusters) over it.

Two different approaches were developed and tested. 
As we will see, the second will give the
expected results, while the first will fail.

\subsection{Tarjan Connected Components algorithm}
Defining the communities as connected components onto the graph\footnote{A connected component
in a graph $A = (N,E)$ is a subset of nodes $A' \in A$  s.t. each node in A' is connected to 
all the other nodes in A' 
}, the first idea was to apply Tarjan's algorithm for connected components, whose pseudo code is in \ref{alg:tarjan}.


In our initial approach, a mere visit, ordered on the arc identifier (i.e. \texttt{for i = 0 to 10000 do strongconnect(i)}) was performed. This visit, though executed with different cuts over the probability of the arcs, evidenced
a strong bias of the order of visit on the found strongly connected components.
As an example, with a cut on probability 0.005, a huge SCC is found, containing almost all nodes. Only few nodes remain
outside this CFC, and some small aggregations can be found between them.
So our second step has been achieving a visiting strategy consistent with the effective traffic measured during the day.
To do so, we used the measurements of the total activity of grids in order to establish a visiting order to be 
followed during the procedure.
\begin{figure}
\begin{verbatim}
input: graph G = (V, E)
output: set of strongly connected components (sets of vertices)
index := 0
S := empty
for each v in V do
    if (v.index is undefined) then
        strongconnect(v)
		
function strongconnect(v):
    v.index := index
    v.lowlink := index
    index := index + 1
    S.push(v)
    for each (v, w) in E:
        if (w.index is undefined):
            strongconnect(w)
        v.lowlink := min(v.lowlink, w.lowlink)
		else if (w is in S):
            v.lowlink := min(v.lowlink, w.index)
    
    if (v.lowlink = v.index):
        start a new strongly connected component
	do
        w := S.pop()
        add w to current strongly connected component
    until (w = v)
    output the current strongly connected component
\end{verbatim}
\caption{Tarjan Strongly Connected Components algorithm}
\label{alg:tarjan}
\end{figure}
We performed the following attempts and different visits on our graph:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Nodes visited for increasing outgoing hourly traffic, with arcs selected with increasing probability. 
\item Nodes visited for decreasing outgoing hourly traffic, with arcs ordered with increasing probability.
\item Nodes visited for decreasing outgoing hourly traffic, with arcs ordered with decreasing probability.
\item Nodes visited for increasing outgoing hourly traffic, with arcs ordered with decreasing probability.
\end{enumerate}

\caption{Strongly connected components found with Tarjan Algorithm.From left to right, top to bottom the hours considered are 12, 13, 14, 15.

\label{fig:tarjan2}
\end{figure}

The image \ref{fig:tarjan1} shows the found strongly connected components in the most trafficated hours 
of the analysis. As it is possible to notice by looking to \ref{fig:analysis}, in fact, during
these hours arcs values are very concentrated near the mean, and thus most of them will be cutted out, making
most of the strongly connected components to disappear in the most trafficated hours of the day.
The results are slightly better in less trafficated hours as shown in \ref{fig:tarjan2}, in which the variance is higher and thus a wider number
of arcs will "save himself" from the performed cutting.
In other attempts, we tried to modify the threshold so that it would save more arcs for the computation,
but we have not been able to find an appropriate threshold leading to a large enough number of clusters
and with an acceptable size.\\
In fact, in most cases, a too low threshold led to few huge connected components whilst too high led to few and very small
connected components.\\
The approach described above, in our opinion, could not lead to the desired results because of two reasons:
\begin{itemize}
\item First, the visiting order, though more meaningful, was still establishing a bias in the search of the components because
of the "paths" eliminated by the original Tarjan algorithm
\item and second, the "static" threshold did not adapt well to changing traffic along the days.
\end{itemize}
To overcome this issues, we decided to implement a small variation of the Tarjan SCC algorithm, in which visited nodes not
becoming part of a strongly connected component could be visited again while searching for others, thus increasing the
complexity of the algorithm but with the advantage of reducing the visit ordering bias.
\\
The other modification that we implemented was that of percentile-based cuts. In this approach, for every hour, the probability
distribution has been calculated and only arc probabilities in a certain percentile have been held, while the others
have been cutted as it was done before with a "static" threshold. This allows for a more fine-grained cutting, allowing
to keep more arcs also in more trafficated hours of the day.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{tarjan3.png}
\caption{Strongly connected components found cutting at the 99-th percentile. Hours depicted are, from left to right and from top to bottom, 12-17.}
\label{fig:tarjan3}
\end{figure}

In \ref{fig:tarjan3} this modified algorithm has been tried with a cut on the 99-th precentile. In the plot
for the SCC found in this case, it is possible to see that most of them are geographically localized (as we expected),
but still their size is very small. \\
However, only few components were able to "survive" across several hours, and are mostly localized in the outskirts 
of the city. \\
Other attempts have been made to find suitable strongly connected components, but also small modification in percentiles
led either to very noise results (with almost all zones in the same component) or to empty results. 
From this approach, we understood that
\begin{enumerate}
\item Very high cuts are needed, because of the high connectivity degree of the graph
\item The statistics of arcs probabilities, however, seem to indicate the existance of zones calling themselves significantly more frequently than others.
\item Visiting strategy has a very strong bias, and probably never considering twice the same arc could lead to eliminate some interesting strongly connected components
\item The number of components is almost always lower than the expected one, however they are uniformly spreaded along the space taken into consideration
\item In different hours, the components vary in their positions, possibly indicating different users behaviours in different hours
\item Specially during hours in which we expected less traffic, components tend to move towards the outskirts, possibly denoting clusters belonging to small towns near Milan
\item The found components are not stable during consecutive hours but they appear and disappear. In the beginning we thought this was due to the "static" cut, but the reproposition
of this behaviour with the percentile denotes that the reason must be either a very noisy dataset or high variation in the users behaviours during the day.
\end{enumerate}

As previously said in Chapter 2, all of this research led us to the conclusion that the best approach was to find a sort of "average behaviour" to analyse and
to move to a different approach, in which communities are seen as clusters. 
To do so, we chose the \emph{Markov Clustering} algorithm, which is known in litterature for the purpose of finding communities in graphs.


For a more complete dissertation on what we did using this approach for discovering communities, we invite you to refer to the attacched file \texttt{CfcSuGrafiOrari.pdf}, in Italian.

\subsection{Markov Clustering}

We then looked at a diffferent approach: Markov Clustering based on the Markov Clustering Algorithm by Stijn van Dongen\footnote{\url{http://micans.org/mcl/}}.

The idea was to reduce noise and emphasize relations in a more structured way
by multiplying the adjancy matrix of the graph by itself until the number of
non-null elements in each row is very low (reduce the number of edges) and with
values probability weight close to 1 (taking the most probable connections).

This algorithm is based on a random-walk view of the graph: the idea is that, being a community
(or, to be more precise, a cluster) connected by more links and more strongly, when moving
casually from one node to another the probability of staying in the cluster
will be way higher than the one of going outside. 

The classical algorithm requires to have self loops (which are naturally present in our dataset), in order to avoid that probability of staying in a node becomes zero on odd iterations, and the graph to be unidirected or at least with several reciprocal arcs between nodes.
This prerequisite is matched by our graphs.

Therefore, the pseudocode of the general algorithm is:
\begin{figure}
\begin{verbatim}
   G is a graph
   r = 4
   set M_1 to be the matrix of random walks on G

   while (change) {
      M_2 =  M_1 * M_1
      M_1 =  inflation(M_2)
      change   = difference(M_1, M_2)
   }

   set CLUSTERING as the components of M_1
\end{verbatim}
\caption{Markov Clustering pseudocode}
\end{figure}

The algorithm is based on the assumption that $G$ is a graph
were edges are weighted with probabilities and the sum
of all edges exiting a node is 1. Thus the adjacency matrix
of the graph is stochastic by rows.

The matrix can be therefore seen as the matrix of probabilities
of transitioning from a state to another state in
a Markov Process, also called random walk matrix.

The Markovian Clustering Algorithm simulates fluxes within the
graphs and calculates, with n iterations, the probabilities of going in
n steps from each node to another one. Taking this simulation to the limit
(or better, to a appropriate approximation of the limit) identifies
the most probable destinations of the flux from each node.

\section{Results}
\label{results}

We present here the results of the community discovery analysis
over different consecutive aggregations periods. We will discuss briefly the results
achieved in the following.

This means that we launched the Aggregation module and constructed 
the following average probability graphs:
\begin{enumerate}
\item One for each of the working days (Monday-Friday) during working hours, meaning from 8 to 13 and from 15 to 17.
\item \textbf{Friday evening and Saturday evening}, from 19 to 23.
\item \textbf{Sunday} during the whole day, namely from 8 to 23.
\end{enumerate}
The aim of these aggregtions is to show the strict correlation of the communities found during working days, and how they change when, instead,
non strictly work correlated aggregations are considered. 

We show the results for each aggregation following two different formats.
In the first, the area taken into consideration is plotted, using different colours and patterns in order to distinguish between different communities. Colours do not have to be considered indicative of any behaviour of the community: they are just assigned at random during the first aggregation and then kept stable in the others by assigning the filling to the community in the next aggregations with the widest area in common with the previous one.
The second approach to display communities reflects automatically the MCL algorithm, in which communities are established using links with common aggregators. In this case, we show how communities connect in each aggregation, separating them in three different images, showing
respectively the small, the medium and the big components. The division between small, medium and big components has been made with a fine tuning on the threshold.

We thus came to considered \emph{small} communities whose average distance, defined as the distance between any arc composing the community divided by the number of areas in it, is at most 5. When this value is between 5 and 20, the community is considered to be medium, while from 21 on it is big.

In the following, the two approaches are shown and commented together. Bigger images and other comparisons can be found on \ref{communities}. 

In the following, we start by showing some statistics on the communities found on each day:

\begin{figure}[H]

\begin{tabular}{| l | r | r | r |}
\hline
\textbf{Aggregation} & \textbf{Cluster Num.} & \textbf{Max.Cluster Size} & \textbf{Avg. Cluster Size} \\ \hline

Tuesday & 101 & 1595 & 74 \\ \hline
Wednesday & 106 & 1230  & 69 \\ \hline

Friday &  98 & 1140 & 78 \\ \hline

Sunday & 104 & 1019 & 71 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Statistics on the clustering achieved on different average probability graph. The number of communities found
in every graph oscillates near to 100. The minimum size of clusters (not shown) is 1 for all aggregations.}
\label{fig:foundClusters}
\end{figure}

Referring to fig. \ref{fig:foundClusters}, it is possible to understand that few huge clusters exist, covering approximate $1/10$-th of the total area taken into consideration, while a wide amount of them is way smaller.
By graphically checking also the image as of fig. \ref{fig:mondayworking}, we can see that in general huge communities are located in the outskirts of the city, where supposedly the population - expecially during working hours - is less dense. When focusing on the city center, the communities become way littler and exibit a less continuous behaviour. We interpretated this as an index of the different population density in every area.

\caption{In a) we show the map of the communities during working hours of November and December Mondays. 
In b) the same communities are shown but divided in big medium and small ones as the arcs connecting the various areas in the grid.
The clustering was performed in 10 iterations, for the reasons explained in \ref{fig:convergencyGraph}}
\label{fig:mondayworking}
\end{figure}

Moreover, it is possible to see in figs. \ref{fig:mondayworking} \ref{fig:tuesdayworking} \ref{fig:wednesdayworking} \ref{fig:thursdayworking} and \ref{fig:fridayworking}, that usually the communities are geographically localized. Since the algorithm we used is not biased anyhow, we can see
that this reflects the intuition that different communities also have a "predominant territory".

Also, it is possible to notice in \ref{fig:mondayworking} and in the following, that some zones are displayed in white. This means that in the final matrix calculated in the clustering procedure, there was not a clear predominance (that we remember, was set to 0.9 to establish a community link) between the possible community with whom they could have been clustered.

In our opinion, they could represent a sort of "contended zone" in which no convergency can be found (or at least, not fast enough) since the population coming from different communities is almost balanced. This could be partially confirmed by the fact that, in our experiments,
we were not able to find such zones in the middle of a geographically continuous community: these white zones appear almost solely on the border separating two communities.

As an example, we can show the case of the nodes with id \texttt{2981}, which on the Monday aggregation, at 10th iteration shows a preference of $0.4999999999972814$ towards grid with id \texttt{3281} and one of $0.5000000000027186$ towards \texttt{3181}.
A possible solution to this issue could be to "lower" the strength of connection required to a zone to join a community. This could work in case of too fast convergency, in which for example a community has a predominating weight in a certain zone, but not enough to make this stand out in just 10 iterations. In such cases, choosing the strongest outgoing arc and establishing a community link with it could be a possible solution. 


However, in a worst case situation like the one of node \texttt{2981} above, if the two addressed nodes belong to different communities this could create some false assignment. Moreover, we considered interesting showing that some "contented" zones between communities could exist.

This situation is clearly shown in fig. \ref{fig:fridayworking} and \ref{fig:party}, representing the communities found respectively in the Friday working hours aggregation and in the one for Friday and Saturday evenings. We can see that the amount of white zones decreases significantly if checked against all other aggregations. In our opinion, this doesn't depend on the different behaviour observed, but from the fact that for both these aggregation the clustering procedure went on for 20 iterations, as can be seen in fig. \ref{fig:convergency}, and though not much, the number of unassigned zones has decreased resulting in the assignment of such contended zones.

In the following, we will discuss the temporal evolution along the days of the week in what can be considered "almost meaningful" different view of the same communities: to be more precise, we will discuss how communities found in the working hours evolve along different working days, and what happens of them when a transition to non working hours is condidered.

To see in a faster way the evolution of communities, we recommend - when possible - to open the URL \href{http://s8.postimg.org/4cscwraxh/Week.gif}{http://s8.postimg.org/4cscwraxh/Week.gif} where a simple GIF image in which the previously aggregation are concatenated is shown.

As a general comment, we want to highlight the fact that the persistency of communities discussed below, between different interval, is for us a result of great interest, corroborating the goodness of the procedure followed.

By checking the fig. \ref{fig:tuesdayworking} against \ref{fig:mondayworking}, as can be possibly done more easily using \ref{fig:allworking},
we see that most of the communities experience only slight variations, either by shrinking or expanding with respect to the previous day.
An interesting event is the absorption of the cluster in the top right corner from his neighbour.

\caption{Communities during working hours of November and December Tuesdays. Clustering performed in 10 iterations.}
\end{figure}
We can see that the communities localized in that area show a great deal of variations, as the splitting re-appears in \ref{fig:wednesdayworking}.
Moreover, while major changes can often be noticed in the suburbia, we can see how the central part of the city exibits a very stable behaviour, with just minor variations along different days of the week.
The differency in the "variation speed" between the city center and the the outskirts could be possibly explained, once again, with the different density of population in the two zones.

\end{figure}


In general, the behaviour doesn't change significantly also on Thursday, shown in fig. \ref{fig:thursdayworking}.

However, even if the semantic aggregation should in our opinion be the same, the clustering process performed for the working hours of Friday shows biggest difference with respect to the previous other days of the working week. Possibly this could be due to the enneraring of the week end\footnote{Or, for all we know, to the effects of the upcoming saturday night fever}. This can be noticed by looking at fig. \ref{fig:fridayworking}.

\begin{figure}[H]

\label{fig:fridayworking}
\end{figure}

Still, when the semantic of the performed aggregation changes, like when dealing with Friday and Saturday evenings and thus with recreational communities, the shape of the communities changes even more significantly than in the previously explained case.
First, as shown also in fig. \ref{fig:foundClusters}, the maximum size for the clusters is the smallest one revealed (951). Also the average decreases significantly, while the number of clusters is the highest one found.

The communities found for this aggregation are thus smaller, and also their shape changes more than could have been observed in all the previous shown images, as can be seen in fig. \ref{fig:partyMap}. However, as one could imagine, the difference is smaller if the Friday working hours (fig. \ref{fig:fridayworking}) are considered instead.
Among other changes that can be seen, we observed the expansion of some communities at expenses of others, while some others were shrinked or fragmentated by the change in the people behaviour.

Finally, we show the communities found for Sunday in fig. \ref{fig:sunday}; in this case we can observe way more white spaces than in the previous cases.

\caption{Communitites found during December and November Sundays. 10 Iterations of MCL have been performed.}
\label{fig:sunday}
\end{figure}

Another feature that we noticed, looking at these images, is that changes are never very rough during the same semantic aggregation.
For example, if we start consider the green-ish community in the top-left corner from Monday to Sunday, we can see that it shrinks gradually all along the week, until it reaches its minimum size on Sunday. The same can be noticed in other cases, observing the behaviour of a single community in time. 

\subsection{Some possible applications}
Several possible applications are possible for the procedure illustrated in this work. We will present some of the most immediate in the following.

The very first idea that can come to mind is an analysis of the population with pubblicitary purposes: by knowing that some zones are mainly populated by a certain community, probably sharing some socio-economic status, instruction and tastes, a campaign manager could use this highly specific information in order to better manage his campaign.

Another possible application of such an analysis is understanding events and their relevancy to the local population by observing the changes in communities. Under the assumption that events - either periodical and expected or unforeseen and occasional - could change the shape in traffic proportionally to their impact on the perception of the population, by using the steady state as measurement is possible to understand which events of interest happened in certain zones, and possibly which events they were.
Of course this approach could not work with our clustering technique unless on really powerful machines, because of the long time required to perform the analysis.

\section{Conclusion and final remarks}

In conclusion, the opinion of the authors is that community discovery
onto a geographical area based on mobile telecommunication data
is possible and that the Markovian random walk approach is capable of giving much better
results than visit based approaches (even with different strategies applied) such as Tarjan's algorithm. 

This is probably due to the assence, in Markovian Clustering, of any bias w.r.t. how to and from where start
and proceed in the visit. Therefore, also other biased machine learning
approaches (such as K-Means) would not probably compete with Markov
Clustering in terms of quality of the output, in this scenario.

However, the Markovian Clustering has also some drawbacks, among which the slowness of the clustering procedure,
imposing it to be performed offline and with somehow simplified data. 

Possible future work could involve trying faster, yet unbiased, random walk based algorithms to perform
analysis on the fly on the traffic. Another study of interest, that we did not investigated in this work, could be
measuring the locality of the communities, for example by analyzing the distribution of the distance between areas
belonging to the same community.
This could possibly give some interesting implication on the amount of mobility and the spreadness of communities.

Several other analysis have been performed on different intervals. In order to grant organicity of the tractation in the previous part, they have not been included.
Still, we want to show such results.
What follows is the output of the Markov Clustering Procedure launched over a single week (the first of december) on different days. On the left, we show the behaviour for a single day, while on the right we show the communities found for the correlated semantic aggregation.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.48\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{monDet/2MonM.png}
\caption{Communities for the 2nd of December 2013 - Morning from 8 to 13}
\end{subfigure}
\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.48\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{monDet/1Mon.png}
\caption{Communities of all Monday's working hours}
\end{subfigure}
\end{figure}

Above, we can recognize a somewhat similar shape in communities, however we can see that in (a) the shapes of communities are less clear and seem more noisy than in (b).

Results get better when comparing two aggregations, but on a wider number of days.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.48\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{wenDet/2WedMatrix.png}
\caption{Communities on the average graph, calculated on all december and november Wednesday mornings}
\end{subfigure}
\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.48\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{wenDet/1Wed.png}
\caption{Communities on all working hours of Wednesday in December and November}
\end{subfigure}
\end{figure}

In the image above, the total Wednesday aggregation are compared with a part, namely the morning working hours.
As we can see, the two images are quite similar, thus indicating either an unlikely strong predominance of the morning over the afternon in the amount of traffic experienced or a similar behaviour of the communities in a semantically meaningful aggregation.

In our opinion, another interesting view is the evolution of communities (seen as edges connecting the areas belonging to it) separated for their size, as it is shown below:
