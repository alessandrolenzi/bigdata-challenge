\subsection{A formal definition}



\subsection{Virtualization Properties}

•  Isolation
•  Encapsulation
•  InterpositionIsolation


\paragraph{Fault Isolation}
–  Fundamental property of virtualization
•  Software Isolation
–  Software versioning
–  DLL Hell
•  Performance Isolation
–  Accomplished through scheduling and resource
allocation

\paragraph{Encapsulation}
•  All VM state can be captured into a file
–  Operate on VM by operating on file
–  mv, cp, rm
•  Complexity
–  Proportional to virtual HW model
–  Independent of guest software configuration

\paragraph{Interposition}
•  All guest actions go through monitor
•  Monitor can inspect, modify, deny
operations
•  Examples:
–  Compression
–  Encryption
–  Profiling
–  Translation

\paragraph{Concrete Perspectives}
•  Process perspective: The system ABI defines the interface
between the process and machine
–  user-level hardware access: logical memory space, user-level
registers and instructions
–  OS mediated: Machine I/O or any shared resource or operations
requiring system privilege.
•  Operating system perspective: ISA defines the interface between
OS and machine
–  system is defined by the underlying machine
–  direct access to all resources
–  manage sharing
•  Virtual machine executes software (process or operating system)
in the same manner as target machine
–  Implemented with both hardware and software
–  VM resources may differ from that of the physical machine
–  Generally not necessary for VM to have equivalent performace

\paragraph{Where is the VM?}
Process virtual machine: supports an individual process
–  Emulates user-level instructions and operating system calls
–  Virtualizing software placed at the ABI layer
System Virtual Machines: emulates the target hardware ISA
–  guest and host environment may use the same ISA
Virtual Machines are implemented as combination of
–  Real hardware
–  Virtualizing software

Virtual machines can provide emulation, optimization
and replication
•  emulation: cross platform compatibility
•  optimization: by considering implementation specific
information
•  replication: making a single resource or platform appear as
many

\section{When}

–  First VM: IBM System/360 Model 40 VM [1965]Why Virtualize?
• First VM: IBM System/360 Model 40 VM [1965]

\section{Why Virtualization}

\paragraph{Consolidation}:
save resources by sharing them. Servers are under-utilized
because of over-provisioning approaches
•  Consolidate resources
–  Server consolidation
–  Client consolidation
–  reduce number of servers
–  reduce space, power and cooling
–  70-80% reduction numbers cited in industry
•  Client consolidation
–  developers: test multiple OS versions, distributed
application configurations on a single machine
–  end user: Windows on Linux, Windows on Mac
–  reduce physical desktop space, avoid managing
multiple physical computersImprove system management


\paragraph{System management} 
CLOUD
–  For both hardware and software
–  From the desktop to the data center
•  Data center management
–  VM portability and live migration a key enabler
–  automate resource scheduling across a pool of
servers
–  optimize for performance and/or power consumption
–  allocate resources for new applications on the fly
–  add/remove servers without application downtime
•  Desktop management
–  centralize management of desktop VM images
–  automate deployment and patching of desktop VMs
–  run desktop VMs on servers or on client machines
•  Industry-cited 10x increase in sysadmin
efficiencyImprove the software lifecycle



•  Improve the software lifecycle
–  Develop, debug, deploy and maintain
applications in virtual machines

•  Increase application availability
–  Fast, automated recoveryConsolidate resources


•  Develop, debug, deploy and maintain
applications in virtual machines
•  Power tool for software developers
–  record/replay application execution deterministically
–  trace application behavior online and offline
–  model distributed hardware for multi-tier applications
•  Application and OS flexibility
–  run any application or operating system
•  Virtual appliances
–  a complete, portable application execution
environmentIncrease application availability
•  Fast, automated recovery
–  automated failover/restart within a cluster
–  disaster recovery across sites
–  VM portability enables this to work reliably across
potentially different hardware configurations
•  Fault tolerance
–  hypervisor-based fault tolerance against hardware
failures [Bressoud and Schneider, SOSP 1995]
–  run two identical VMs on two different machines,
backup VM takes over if primary VM’s hardware
crashes
–  commercial prototypes beginning to emerge (2008)

Why?
• Consolidate resources
• Server consolidation
• Client consolidation
• Improve system management
• For both hardware and software
• From the desktop to the datacenter
• Improve software lifecycle
• Develop, debug, deploy and maintain applications in virtual
machines
• Increase application availability
• Fast, automated recovery

TableIssues
•  Guest page table consistency
–  What happens when the guest changes an entry
in its page table?
–  What happens when the guest switches to a new
page table on a process context switch?
•  Performance
–  Guest context switches flush entire software TLB
–  Minimize hidden page faults
–  Aggressive flushing will cause flood of hpfs every
guest context switch
–  Keep one shadow page table per guest processVirtualized Address Translation:

TableIssues
•  Benefits
–  Handle page faults in same way as Emulated TLB
–  Fast guest context switching
•  Page Table Consistency
–  Guest may not need invalidate TLB on writes to
off-line page tables
–  Need to trace writes to shadow page tables to
invalidate entries
•  Memory Bloat
–  Caching guest page tables takes memory
–  Need to determine when guest has reused page
tablesHardware-assisted Virtualization:
Nested Page Tables
•  Nested paging uses an additional nested page table (nPT) to translate guest
physical addresses to system physical addresses
•  The gPT maps guest linear addresses to guest physical addresses. Nested page
tables (nPT) map guest physical addresses to system physical addresses.
•  Guest and nested page tables are set up by the guest and hypervisor respectively.
When a guest attempts to reference memory using a linear address and nested
paging is enabled, the page walker performs a 2-dimensional walk using the gPT
and nPT to translate the guest linear address to system physical address.
•  Nested paging removes the overheads associated with shadow paging. Unlike
shadow paging, once the nested pages are populated, the hypervisor does not
need to intercept and emulate guest’s modification of gPT.
•  However because nested paging introduces an additional level of translation, the
TLB miss cost could be larger.Reclaiming Memory: ballooning

•  Motivation
–  Multiple VMs running same OS, apps
–  Deduplicate redundant copies of code, data,
zeros
•  Transparent page sharing
–  Map multiple PPNs to single MPN copy-on-write
–  Pioneered by Disco [Bugnion et al. SOSP ’97],
but required guest OS hooks
•  VMware content-based sharing
–  General-purpose, no guest OS changes
–  Background activity saves memory over timePage Sharing: Scan Candidate PPN

\section{I/O VirtualizationType of devices}
•  Dedicated Devices
–  Monitor, keyboard, mouse
–  No virtualization required, but VMM routing because guest
OS runs in user mode
–  Interrupt handled by VM on activation by VMM
•  Partitioned Devices
–  Disks
–  VMM maintains a map of parameters and re-issues the
requests to physical devices
•  Shared Devices
–  Network adapter
–  VMM translates through a virtual device drivers
•  Spooled Devices
–  Printer
•  Nonexistent Devices
–  Comm networkPerforming I/O

HardwareVirtualizing I/O
•  I/O Operations level
–  I/O runs in privileged mode
–  Trap in user mode
–  Difficult to reverse engineer a complete I/O action
•  Device drivers level
– 
– 
– 
– 
Needs virtual device drivers
VMM intercepts calls to virtual device drivers
Must know guest OS device driver implementation
Real drivers needed for native VMMs
•  System calls level
–  Most efficient
–  Must know guest OS ABI to I/O and rewrite it taking
care of emulation of everything else not directly
related to I/O.
