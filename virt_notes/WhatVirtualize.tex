Modern computer system is very complex: 
Hundreds of millions of transistors
Interconnected high-speed I/O devices
Networking infrastructures
Operating systems, libraries, applications
Graphics and networking software


To manage this complexity we use Levels of Abstractions which
Allows implementation details at lower levels of design to be ignored or simplified,
Each level is separated by well-defined interfaces, so
that the design of a higher level can be decoupled
from the lower levelsLayers of Abstraction


Abstraction: used to manage complexity typically defined in layers (VM i ), each layer has its own language (L i ) and data structures (R i )   lowest layers implemented in hardware, higher layers implemented in
software

A Machine: denotes the system on which software is executed.

Typical Layers are 
VM 4 : Applications 
VM 3 : Operating System
VM 2 : Assembler Machine
VM 1 : Firmware Machine
VM 0 : Hardware Machine

–  to an operating system this is generally the physical system
–  to an application program a machine is defined by the combination of hardware and OS-implemented abstractions
 

Abstraction layers have well defined interfaces
–  A processors instruction set defines such an interface: IA-32, IBM
PowerPC, ARM
•  Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
–  defines hardware/software boundary
–  user ISA: portion of architecture visible to an application program
–  system ISA: portion of architecture visible to the supervisor software
(e.g., OS)

ISA

Application Binary Interface (ABI): defines program interface to the hardware resources and services 
user ISA
system calls
• 
• 
• 
system instructions are not included in the ABI
user instructions allow program direct access to hardware
indirect interface for accessing shared system resources and services
implemented by the supervisor software
Application Programming Interface (API)
– 
– 
– 
defined in terms of a high-level language (HHL)
typically implemented as a system library and defined at the source level (for example libc which is linked
into programʼ’s address space)
specifies operations available by system which are implemented by the operating system or other system
